Faced with having to script out schema and objects from a SQL Server database, the only option was using SMO. That's a Windows-only solution that has some known bugs and performance problems. Using the management views in SQL Server you can script everything out yourself. So I created [mossy](https://github.com/mroach/mossy) to do that in Ruby. It can script out a whole database in under 15 queries and depending on the size of modules, should only takes a few seconds.
