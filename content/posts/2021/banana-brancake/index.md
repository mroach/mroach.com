## Why a brancake?

For as long as I can remember I've been the "always hungry" type. I could eat
a meal, have seconds, have a food coma, and then be hungry again.

I wanted to break out of this pattern for the primary reasons of:
* Keeping my waistline in check.
* Avoiding the afternoon slump i.e. food comas.
* Not being a hangry monster.

I watched some good videos with titles like *Why diets fail* and
*Eliminating stubborn belly fat*. I also enjoyed the book *[How to Eat]*.

The main takeaways were:
* Crash dieting always fails.
* The only good diet is one you can sustain as a permanent lifestyle.
* A diet is only sustainable if you're not hungry all the time.
* High fiber foods make you feel satisfied for longer and avoid food comas.
* Many food-like products are processed to remove the fiber so you won't feel full.

This got me thinking: *I want to eat fiber-rich foods!*

I searched around for foods that contain *lots* of fiber. Wheat bran was always
near the top of the list. I found some interesting recipes, but many of them
had added sugar or high-sugar fruits.
A pancake made with wheat bran piqued my interest and ticked my boxes.

I tried several variations until settling on ingredients and ratios that worked
well for me and consistently produced pancakes that were easy to make, nice to eat, and 
most importantly: kept me feeling full all morning.

## Preparation

I make these brancakes every morning. To keep the daily bake simple, I pre-mix
all the dry ingredients and store them in a container. That way in the morning
I just have to mash up the banana, whisk the egg, and then add some dry ingredient
mixture. Easy.

### Dry ingredients

{{< figure src="images/dry_mix_bowl.jpg" alt="Mixed-up dry ingredients" thumb="300" class="float-right" >}}

Like most recipes, the amounts here are not an exact science. They're what I've
roughly settled on after trial and error and what I like.

It's easy to make in any quantity you want by following the *parts*.
Then you can use cups, decilitres, heaped spoonfuls, whatever you like,
and just keep the ratios the same.

Add everything to a bowl and mix it up with a whisk.

 {{<div "table table-slim">}}
| US Measure   | Parts | Ingredient         |
| -----------: | ----: | ------------------ |
| 2 cups       | 4     | Wheat bran         |
| 1 cup        | 2     | Whole wheat flour  |
| 1 cup        | 2     | Oats               |
| &frac12; cup | 1     | Oat bran           |
| &frac12; cup | 1     | Flax seed          |
| 1 tsp        |       | Baking powder      |
{{</div>}}

## Making one brancake

* **&frac12; ripe banana**, mashed with a fork
* **1 egg**
* splash of milk (optional)

Mix it all up with the fork.

This usually mixes well with **4 heaped tablespoons** of the dry mixture.

If it seems too dry, add a splash of milk.

That's it! I cook it in a small pan with coconut oil on medium heat, flipping
it once bubbles start to appear.

## The finished product

I usually have a drizzle of maple syrup on them. Sometimes a bit of crunchy peanut butter.
If I'm feeling decadent, pistachio cream is fantastic.

## Nutrition Facts

These nutrition facts are per 100g of the dry mixture:

 {{<div "table table-slim">}}
| Ingredient  | Fat  | Carbs | Fibre  | Protein |
| ----------  | ---: | ----: | -----: | ------: |
| Wheat bran  | 1.0g | 4.0g  | 9.9g   | 3.5g    |
| Wheat flour | 1.0g | 25.8g | 4.3g   | 4.9g    |
| Oats        | 0.5g | 4.1g  | 1.6g   | 2.3g    |
| Oat bran    | 0.7g | 5.9g  | 1.2g   | 1.6g    |
| Flax seed   | 2.6g | 0.1g  | 2.0g   | 1.5g    |
| **Total**   | 5.8g | 39.9g | 19.0g  | 13.9g   |
{{</div>}}

Each brancake uses about 50g of the dry mixture, so we can cut those numbers in half and then add the numbers for an egg and half a banana to get:

<table class="table-slim">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Per brancake</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Fat</td><td>8.1g </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Carbs</td><td>35.5g</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fibre</td><td>11.3g</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Protein</td><td>13.6g</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

We can subtract the **Fibre** from the **Carbs** to get **24.2g** of **Net Carbs** which
are carbs actually absorbed by the body.

Recommendations for daily intake of fibre vary by source and your calorie intake
but, **25g** is a typical target. So one brancake gets you about halfway there!


## Conclusion

I've been eating these every day for a year now and I haven't got sick of them.
They usually keep me satiated until lunch time and then some, so I can say
I've met my goals with these things.
