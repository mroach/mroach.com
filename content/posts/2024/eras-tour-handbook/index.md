When I went to my first Eras Tour show, I was out of the loop on a lot of the
fan chants and interactions. Before my next show I got up to speed thanks to
some videos and guides people had put together.

Since then, the tour has changed to include The Tortured Poets Department
and the removal of some other songs.

I know people going to shows with friends or relatives that aren't familiar
with Taylor's music, let alone the chants or setlist.

I wanted to create a little handbook with lyrics, chants, and some basic info
so they don't feel like they're missing what's going on.

Since mobile data can be spotty or completely non-functional in some venues,
I decided an e-book would be a good format since they're easy to use offline,
you can change text sizes, navigate quickly with the table of contents, etc.

You can download the <a href="https://dl.mroach.com/eras-tour-handbook.epub">.epub</a> on most any device.
